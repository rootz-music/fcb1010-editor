## Next Steps & Expansion

1. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Expand and update `docs/` with more usage examples and troubleshooting tips.
   - Add API documentation for all public classes and functions.

2. **Testing**
   - Increase test coverage, especially for CLI and integration scripts.
   - Add integration tests for hardware communication (mocking MIDI if needed).

3. **Code Quality**
   - Address remaining lint warnings (mainly line length, E501).
   - Refactor long functions for readability and maintainability.

4. **Features**
   - Enhance Google Sheets integration and document its setup.

   - Implement a GUI (e.g., with Tkinter or PyQt) for users who prefer graphical editing.

5. **Packaging & Distribution**
   - Add a `setup.py` or update for PyPI distribution.
   - Provide Dockerfile or devcontainer.json for reproducible environments.

6. **Developer Experience**
   - Add pre-commit hooks for linting/formatting.
   - Add GitHub Actions for CI (lint, test, build).

7. **User Experience**
   - Add more helpful CLI prompts and error messages.
   - Support batch operations and scripting via CLI arguments.

8. **Community**
   - Write a Code of Conduct and expand contribution guidelines.
   - Encourage users to submit issues and feature requests.
